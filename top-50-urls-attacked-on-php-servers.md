# Top 50 URLs Attacked on PHP Servers
## December 13, 2018
### updated October 10, 2019

Below is a list of PHP URLs that I have seen robots attempting to attack. They are listed from most frequent to least frequent. 

Notes: 

1. A lot of rouge servers attack the same set of URLs, so I would reason that it is the same malware running on different servers.

2. I block a lot of robots, so that could lead to this list being a bit biased.
