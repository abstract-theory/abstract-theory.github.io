<h3>Notes on Web Crawlers for 2020</h3>
<i>date: April 6th, 2020</i>
</p>
<p>
There are numerous robots continuously crawling web sites. This will focus on robots that are of more relevance and interest to web developers. There is some slant towards (or emphasis on) the English language and the US. For the most part, frequently observed spam bots, malware, and the likes will be omitted.

<p>
    <div class="bot"><b>Googlebot:</b> Google's primary crawler.</div>

    <div class="bot"><b>Bingbot:</b> This is Bing's crawler. In the U.S. hold, roughly, 10%-30% market share, at least, when including Yahoo.</div>

    <div class="bot"><b>DuckDuckBot:</b> The main crawler for Duck Duck Go(oose). Duck Duck Go pitches itself as the privacy search engine. In other words, they don't track you and maintain data about you as other general purpose search engines do.</div>

    <div class="bot"><b>DuckDuckBot-Favicons-Bot:</b> Another bot from Duck Duck Go that appears to look just for favicons.</div>

    <div class="bot"><b>Baidu:</b> The biggest search engine in China and serves what is easily argued to be the largest sector of internet users. Forward DNS lookups fail, and no other measures for verifying their spiders were found.</div>

    <div class="bot"><b>Sogou:</b> Another major Chinese search engine. They are verifiable. However, they can have very busy crawlers. They don't use 8-bit IP blocks, and they crawl from a large number of addresses.</div>

    <div class="bot"><b>facebookexternalhit:</b> "The Facebook Crawler scrapes the HTML of a website that was shared on Facebook ... ...IP addresses change often."
